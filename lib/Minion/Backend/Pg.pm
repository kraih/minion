=head1 NAME

Minion::Backend::Pg - PostgreSQL backend

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Backend::Pg;

  my $backend = Minion::Backend::Pg->new('postgresql://postgres@/test');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> is a backend for L<Minion> based on L<Mojo::Pg>. All
necessary tables will be created automatically with a set of migrations named
C<minion>. Note that this backend uses many bleeding edge features, so only the
latest, stable version of PostgreSQL is fully supported.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> inherits all attributes from L<Minion::Backend> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 pg

  my $pg   = $backend->pg;
  $backend = $backend->pg(Mojo::Pg->new);

L<Mojo::Pg> object used to store all data.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> inherits all methods from L<Minion::Backend> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 dequeue

  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);

Wait for job, dequeue it and transition from C<inactive> to C<active> state or
return C<undef> if queue was empty.

=head2 enqueue

  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue('foo');
  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args]);
  my $job_id = $backend->enqueue(foo => [@args] => {priority => 1});

Enqueue a new job with C<inactive> state.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now).

=item priority

  priority => 5

Job priority, defaults to C<0>.

=back

=head2 fail_job

  my $bool = $backend->fail_job($job_id);
  my $bool = $backend->fail_job($job_id, 'Something went wrong!');
  my $bool = $backend->fail_job($job_id, {msg => 'Something went wrong!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<failed> state.

=head2 finish_job

  my $bool = $backend->finish_job($job_id);
  my $bool = $backend->finish_job($job_id, 'All went well!');
  my $bool = $backend->finish_job($job_id, {msg => 'All went well!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<finished> state.

=head2 job_info

  my $job_info = $backend->job_info($job_id);

Get information about a job or return C<undef> if job does not exist.

  # Check job state
  my $state = $backend->job_info($job_id)->{state};

  # Get job result
  my $result = $backend->job_info($job_id)->{result};

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

=item args

Job arguments.

=item created

Time job was created.

=item delayed

Time job was delayed to.

=item finished

Time job was finished.

=item priority

=item retried

Time job has been retried.

=item retries

Number of times job has been retried.

=item started

Time job was started.

=item state

Current job state.

=item task

Task name.

=item worker

Id of worker that is processing the job.

=back

=head2 list_jobs

  my $batch = $backend->list_jobs($offset, $limit);
  my $batch = $backend->list_jobs($offset, $limit, {state => 'inactive'});

Returns the same information as L</"job_info"> but in batches.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item state

  state => 'inactive'

List only jobs in this state.

=item task

  task => 'test'

List only jobs for this task.

=back

=head2 list_workers

  my $batch = $backend->list_workers($offset, $limit);

Returns the same information as L</"worker_info"> but in batches.

=head2 new

  my $backend = Minion::Backend::Pg->new('postgresql://postgres@/test');

Construct a new L<Minion::Backend::Pg> object.

=head2 register_worker

  my $worker_id = $backend->register_worker;
  my $worker_id = $backend->register_worker($worker_id);

Register worker or send heartbeat to show that this worker is still alive.

=head2 remove_job

  my $bool = $backend->remove_job($job_id);

Remove C<failed>, C<finished> or C<inactive> job from queue.

=head2 repair

  $backend->repair;

Repair worker registry and job queue if necessary.

=head2 reset

  $backend->reset;

Reset job queue.

=head2 retry_job

  my $bool = $backend->retry_job($job_id);
  my $bool = $backend->retry_job($job_id, {delay => 10});

=over 2

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now).

=back

=head2 stats

  my $stats = $backend->stats;

Get statistics for jobs and workers.

=head2 unregister_worker

  $backend->unregister_worker($worker_id);

Unregister worker.

=head2 worker_info

  my $worker_info = $backend->worker_info($worker_id);

Get information about a worker or return C<undef> if worker does not exist.

  # Check worker host
  my $host = $backend->worker_info($worker_id)->{host};

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

=item host
