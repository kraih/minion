=head1 NAME

Minion::Backend::Pg - PostgreSQL backend

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Backend::Pg;

  my $backend = Minion::Backend::Pg->new('postgresql://postgres@/test');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> is a backend for L<Minion> based on L<Mojo::Pg>. All
necessary tables will be created automatically with a set of migrations named
C<minion>. Note that this backend uses many bleeding edge features, so only the
latest, stable version of PostgreSQL is fully supported.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> inherits all attributes from L<Minion::Backend> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 pg

  my $pg   = $backend->pg;
  $backend = $backend->pg(Mojo::Pg->new);

L<Mojo::Pg> object used to store all data.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Backend::Pg> inherits all methods from L<Minion::Backend> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 broadcast

  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command');
  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args]);
  my $bool = $backend->broadcast('some_command', [@args], [$id1, $id2, $id3]);

Broadcast remote control command to one or more workers.

=head2 dequeue

  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5);
  my $job_info = $backend->dequeue($worker_id, 0.5, {queues => ['important']});

Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue it and transition from
C<inactive> to C<active> state, or return C<undef> if queues were empty.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item queues

  queues => ['important']

One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to C<default>.

=back

These fields are currently available:

Transition from C<active> to C<failed> state, and if there are attempts
remaining, transition back to C<inactive> with a delay based on
L<Minion/"backoff">.
