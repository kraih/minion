=head1 NAME

Minion::Job - Minion job

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Job;

  my $job = Minion::Job->new(id => $id, minion => $minion, task => 'foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Job> is a container for L<Minion> jobs.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Minion::Job> inherits all events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and can emit the
following new ones.

=head2 failed

  $job->on(failed => sub {
    my ($job, $err) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process managing this job or the process performing it,
after it has transitioned to the C<failed> state.

  $job->on(failed => sub {
    my ($job, $err) = @_;
    say "Something went wrong: $err";
  });

=head2 finished

  $job->on(finished => sub {
    my ($job, $result) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process managing this job or the process performing it,
after it has transitioned to the C<finished> state.

  $job->on(finished => sub {
    my ($job, $result) = @_;
    my $id = $job->id;
    say "Job $id is finished.";
  });

=head2 spawn

  $job->on(spawn => sub {
    my ($job, $pid) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process managing this job, after a new process has been
spawned for processing.

  $job->on(spawn => sub {
    my ($job, $pid) = @_;
    my $id = $job->id;
    say "Job $id running in process $pid";
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Job> implements the following attributes.

=head2 args

  my $args = $job->args;
  $job     = $job->args([]);

Arguments passed to task.

=head2 id

  my $id = $job->id;
  $job   = $job->id($id);

Job id.

=head2 minion

  my $minion = $job->minion;
  $job       = $job->minion(Minion->new);

L<Minion> object this job belongs to.

=head2 retries

  my $retries = $job->retries;
  $job        = $job->retries(5);

Number of times job has been retried.

=head2 task

  my $task = $job->task;
  $job     = $job->task('foo');

Task name.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Job> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and implements
the following new ones.

=head2 app

  my $app = $job->app;

Get application from L<Minion/"app">.

  # Longer version
  my $app = $job->minion->app;

=head2 fail

  my $bool = $job->fail;
  my $bool = $job->fail('Something went wrong!');
  my $bool = $job->fail({whatever => 'Something went wrong!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<failed> state, and if there are attempts
remaining, transition back to C<inactive> with a delay based on
L<Minion/"backoff">.

=head2 finish

  my $bool = $job->finish;
  my $bool = $job->finish('All went well!');
  my $bool = $job->finish({whatever => 'All went well!'});

Transition from C<active> to C<finished> state.

=head2 info

  my $info = $job->info;

Get job information.

  # Check job state
  my $state = $job->info->{state};

  # Get job result
  my $result = $job->info->{result};

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

  finished => 784111777

Time job was finished.

=item priority

  priority => 3

Job priority.

=item queue

  queue => 'important'

Queue name.

=item result

  result => 'All went well!'

=item retried

  retried => 784111777

Time job has been retried.

=item retries

  retries => 3

Number of times job has been retried.

=item started

  started => 784111777

Time job was started.

=item state

  state => 'inactive'

=item task

  task => 'foo'

Task name.

=item worker

  worker => '154'

Id of worker that is processing the job.

=back

=head2 is_finished

  my $bool = $job->is_finished($pid);

Check if job performed with L</"start"> is finished.

=head2 perform

  $job->perform;

=head2 remove

  my $bool = $job->remove;

Remove C<failed>, C<finished> or C<inactive> job from queue.

=head2 retry

  my $bool = $job->retry;
  my $bool = $job->retry({delay => 10});

Transition from C<failed> or C<finished> state back to C<inactive>, already
C<inactive> jobs may also be retried to change options.

These options are currently available:
