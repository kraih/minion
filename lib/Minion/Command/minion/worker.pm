    -I, --heartbeat-interval <seconds>   Heartbeat interval, defaults to 300
    -j, --jobs <number>                  Maximum number of jobs to perform
                                         parallel in forked worker processes,

                                         defaults to "default"
    -R, --repair-interval <seconds>      Repair interval, up to half of this
                                         value can be subtracted randomly to
                                         make sure not all workers repair at the

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> starts a L<Minion> worker. You can have as
many workers as you like.

=head1 SIGNALS

The L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> process can be controlled at runtime
with the following signals.

=head2 INT, TERM

Stop gracefully after finishing the current jobs.

=head2 QUIT

Stop immediately without finishing the current jobs.

=head1 REMOTE CONTROL COMMANDS

The L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> process can be controlled at runtime
through L<Minion::Command::minion::job>, from anywhere in the network, by
broadcasting the following remote control commands.

=head2 jobs

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]'
  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]' 23

Instruct one or more workers to change the number of jobs to perform
concurrently. Setting this value to C<0> will effectively pause the worker. That
means all current jobs will be finished, but no new ones accepted, until the
number is increased again.

=head2 stop

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]'
  $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]' 23

Instruct one or more workers to stop a job that is currently being performed
immediately. This command will be ignored by workers that do not have a job
matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast this command to all workers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> inherits all attributes from
L<Mojolicious::Command> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 description

  my $description = $worker->description;
  $worker         = $worker->description('Foo');

Short description of this command, used for the command list.

=head2 usage

  my $usage = $worker->usage;
  $worker   = $worker->usage('Foo');

Usage information for this command, used for the help screen.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Command::minion::worker> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Command> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 run

  $worker->run(@ARGV);

Run this command.

=head1 SEE ALSO
