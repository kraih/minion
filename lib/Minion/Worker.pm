=head1 NAME

Minion::Worker - Minion worker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion::Worker;

  my $worker = Minion::Worker->new(minion => $minion);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion::Worker> performs jobs for L<Minion>.

=head1 SIGNALS

The L<Minion::Worker> process can be controlled at runtime with the following
signals.

=head2 INT, TERM

Stop gracefully after finishing the current jobs.

=head2 QUIT

Stop immediately without finishing the current jobs.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Minion::Worker> inherits all events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and can emit
the following new ones.

=head2 dequeue

  $worker->on(dequeue => sub {
    my ($worker, $job) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process after a job has been dequeued.

  $worker->on(dequeue => sub {
    my ($worker, $job) = @_;
    my $id = $job->id;
    say "Job $id has been dequeued.";
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion::Worker> implements the following attributes.

=head2 commands

  my $commands = $worker->commands;
  $worker      = $worker->commands({jobs => sub {...}});

Registered worker remote control commands.

=head2 dequeue_interval

  my $interval = $worker->dequeue_interval;
  $worker      = $worker->dequeue_interval(2);

The rate in seconds at which the worker will poll for additional jobs to dequeue.

=head2 id

  my $id  = $worker->id;
  $worker = $worker->id($id);

Worker id.

=head2 minion

  my $minion = $worker->minion;
  $worker    = $worker->minion(Minion->new);

L<Minion> object this worker belongs to.

=head2 status

  my $status = $worker->status;
  $worker    = $worker->status({queues => ['default', 'important']);

Status information to configure workers started with L</"run"> and to share
every time L</"register"> is called.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion::Worker> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and
implements the following new ones.

=head2 add_command

  $worker = $worker->add_command(jobs => sub {...});

Register a worker remote control command.

  $worker->add_command(foo => sub {
    my ($worker, @args) = @_;
    ...
  });

=head2 dequeue

  my $job = $worker->dequeue(0.5);
  my $job = $worker->dequeue(0.5 => {queues => ['important']});

Wait a given amount of time in seconds for a job, dequeue L<Minion::Job> object
and transition from C<inactive> to C<active> state, or return C<undef> if queues
were empty.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item id

  id => '10023'

Dequeue a specific job.

=item queues

  queues => ['important']

One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 info

  my $info = $worker->info;

Get worker information.

  # Check worker host
  my $host = $worker->info->{host};

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

=item host

  host => 'localhost'

Worker host.

=item jobs

  jobs => ['10023', '10024', '10025', '10029']

Ids of jobs the worker is currently processing.

=item notified

  notified => 784111777

Epoch time worker sent the last heartbeat.

=item pid

  pid => 12345

Process id of worker.

=item started

  started => 784111777

Epoch time worker was started.

=item status

  status => {queues => ['default', 'important']}

Hash reference with whatever status information the worker would like to share.

=back

=head2 process_commands

  $worker = $worker->process_commands;

Process worker remote control commands.

=head2 register

  $worker = $worker->register;

Register worker or send heartbeat to show that this worker is still alive.

=head2 run

  $worker->run;

Run worker and wait for L</"SIGNALS">.

These L</"status"> options are currently available:

=over 2

=item command_interval

  command_interval => 20

Worker remote control command interval, defaults to C<10>.

=item heartbeat_interval

  heartbeat_interval => 60

Heartbeat interval, defaults to C<300>.

=item jobs

  jobs => 12

Maximum number of jobs to perform parallel in forked worker processes, defaults
to C<4>.

=item queues

  queues => ['test']

One or more queues to get jobs from, defaults to C<default>.

=item repair_interval

  repair_interval => 3600

Repair interval, up to half of this value can be subtracted randomly to make
sure not all workers repair at the same time, defaults to C<21600> (6 hours).

=back

These remote control L</"commands"> are currently available:

=over 2

=item jobs

  $minion->broadcast('jobs', [10]);
  $minion->broadcast('jobs', [10], [$worker_id]);

Instruct one or more workers to change the number of jobs to perform
concurrently. Setting this value to C<0> will effectively pause the worker. That
means all current jobs will be finished, but no new ones accepted, until the
number is increased again.

=item stop

  $minion->broadcast('stop', [10025]);
  $minion->broadcast('stop', [10025], [$worker_id]);

Instruct one or more workers to stop a job that is currently being performed
immediately. This command will be ignored by workers that do not have a job
matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast this command to all workers.

=back

=head2 unregister

  $worker = $worker->unregister;

Unregister worker.
