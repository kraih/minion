=head1 NAME

Minion - Job queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Minion;

  # Connect to backend
  my $minion = Minion->new(Pg => 'postgresql://postgres@/test');

  # Add tasks
  $minion->add_task(something_slow => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    sleep 5;
    say 'This is a background worker process.';
  });

  # Enqueue jobs
  $minion->enqueue(something_slow => ['foo', 'bar']);
  $minion->enqueue(something_slow => [1, 2, 3] => {priority => 5});

  # Perform jobs for testing
  $minion->enqueue(something_slow => ['foo', 'bar']);
  $minion->perform_jobs;

  # Build more sophisticated workers
  my $worker = $minion->repair->worker;
  while (int rand 2) {
    if (my $job = $worker->register->dequeue(5)) { $job->perform }
  }
  $worker->unregister;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Minion> is a job queue for the L<Mojolicious|http://mojolicious.org> real-time
web framework with support for multiple named queues, priorities, delayed jobs,
job results, retries with backoff, distributed workers, parallel processing and
multiple backends (such as L<PostgreSQL|http://www.postgresql.org>).

A job queue allows you to process time and/or computationally intensive tasks
in background processes, outside of the request/response lifecycle. Among those
tasks you'll commonly find image resizing, spam filtering, HTTP downloads,
building tarballs, warming caches and basically everything else you can imagine
that's not super fast.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  plugin Minion => {Pg => 'postgresql://sri:s3cret@localhost/test'};

  # Slow task
  app->minion->add_task(poke_mojo => sub {
    my $job = shift;
    $job->app->ua->get('mojolicious.org');
    $job->app->log->debug('We have poked mojolicious.org for a visitor');
  });

  # Perform job in a background worker process
  get '/' => sub {
    my $c = shift;
    $c->minion->enqueue('poke_mojo');
    $c->render(text => 'We will poke mojolicious.org for you soon.');
  };

  app->start;

Background worker processes are usually started with the command
L<Minion::Command::minion::worker>, which becomes automatically available when
an application loads the plugin L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion>.

  $ ./myapp.pl minion worker

Jobs can be managed right from the command line with
L<Minion::Command::minion::job>.

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job

Every job can fail or succeed, but not get lost, the system is eventually
consistent and will preserve job results for as long as you like, depending on
L</"remove_after">. While individual workers can fail in the middle of
processing a job, the system will detect this and ensure that no job is left in
an uncertain state, depending on L</"missing_after">.

=head1 GROWING

And as your application grows, you can move tasks into application specific
plugins.

  package MyApp::Task::PokeMojo;
  use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious::Plugin';

  sub register {
    my ($self, $app) = @_;
    $app->minion->add_task(poke_mojo => sub {
      my $job = shift;
      $job->app->ua->get('mojolicious.org');
      $job->app->log->debug('We have poked mojolicious.org for a visitor');
    });
  }

  1;

Which are loaded like any other plugin from your application.

  # Mojolicious
  $app->plugin('MyApp::Task::PokeMojo');

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin 'MyApp::Task::PokeMojo';

=head1 EVENTS

L<Minion> inherits all events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and can emit the
following new ones.

=head2 worker

  $minion->on(worker => sub {
    my ($minion, $worker) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process after it has been created.

  $minion->on(worker => sub {
    my ($minion, $worker) = @_;
    my $id = $worker->id;
    say "Worker $$:$id started.";
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion> implements the following attributes.

=head2 app

  my $app = $minion->app;
  $minion = $minion->app(MyApp->new);

Application for job queue, defaults to a L<Mojo::HelloWorld> object.

=head2 backend

  my $backend = $minion->backend;
  $minion     = $minion->backend(Minion::Backend::Pg->new);

Backend, usually a L<Minion::Backend::Pg> object.

=head2 backoff

  my $cb  = $minion->backoff;
  $minion = $minion->backoff(sub {...});

A callback used to calculate the delay for automatically retried jobs, defaults
to C<(retries ** 4) + 15> (15, 16, 31, 96, 271, 640...), which means that
roughly C<25> attempts can be made in C<21> days.

  $minion->backoff(sub {
    my $retries = shift;
    return ($retries ** 4) + 15 + int(rand 30);
  });

=head2 missing_after

  my $after = $minion->missing_after;
  $minion   = $minion->missing_after(172800);

Amount of time in seconds after which workers without a heartbeat will be
considered missing and removed from the registry by L</"repair">, defaults to
C<86400> (1 day).

=head2 remove_after

  my $after = $minion->remove_after;
  $minion   = $minion->remove_after(86400);

Amount of time in seconds after which jobs that have reached the state
C<finished> will be removed automatically by L</"repair">, defaults to
C<864000> (10 days).

=head2 tasks

  my $tasks = $minion->tasks;
  $minion   = $minion->tasks({foo => sub {...}});

Registered tasks.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and implements the
following new ones.

=head2 add_task

  $minion = $minion->add_task(foo => sub {...});

Register a task.

  # Job with result
  $minion->add_task(add => sub {
    my ($job, $first, $second) = @_;
    $job->finish($first + $second);
  });
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(add => [1, 1]);
  my $result = $minion->job($id)->info->{result};

=head2 enqueue

  my $id = $minion->enqueue('foo');
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args]);
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args] => {priority => 1});

Enqueue a new job with C<inactive> state. Arguments get serialized by the
L</"backend"> (often with L<Mojo::JSON>), so you shouldn't send objects and be
careful with binary data, nested data structures with hash and array references
are fine though.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item attempts

  attempts => 25

Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay based on
L</"backoff"> after the first attempt, defaults to C<1>.

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now).

=item lock

  lock => 'some_key'

Unique key for all C<active> and C<inactive> tasks.

=item priority

  priority => 5

Job priority, defaults to C<0>.

=item queue

  queue => 'important'

Queue to put job in, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 job

  my $job = $minion->job($id);

Get L<Minion::Job> object without making any changes to the actual job or
return C<undef> if job does not exist.

  # Check job state
  my $state = $minion->job($id)->info->{state};

  # Get job result
  my $result = $minion->job($id)->info->{result};

=head2 new

  my $minion = Minion->new(Pg => 'postgresql://postgres@/test');

Construct a new L<Minion> object.

=head2 perform_jobs

  $minion->perform_jobs;
  $minion->perform_jobs({queues => ['important']});

Perform all jobs, very useful for testing.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item queues

  queues => ['important']

One or more queues to dequeue jobs from, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 repair

  $minion = $minion->repair;

Repair worker registry and job queue if necessary.

=head2 reset

  $minion = $minion->reset;

Reset job queue.

=head2 stats

  my $stats = $minion->stats;

Get statistics for jobs and workers.

  # Check idle workers
  my $idle = $minion->stats->{inactive_workers};

These fields are currently available:

=over 2

=item active_jobs

  active_jobs => 100

Number of jobs in C<active> state.

=item active_workers

  active_workers => 100

Number of workers that are currently processing a job.
