L<Minion> is a job queue for the L<Mojolicious|http://mojolicious.org> real-time
web framework, with support for multiple named queues, priorities, delayed jobs,
job dependencies, job progress, job results, retries with backoff, rate
limiting, unique jobs, statistics, distributed workers, parallel processing,
autoscaling, remote control, admin ui, resource leak protection and multiple
backends (such as L<PostgreSQL|http://www.postgresql.org>).

Job queues allow you to process time and/or computationally intensive tasks in
background processes, outside of the request/response lifecycle. Among those
tasks you'll commonly find image resizing, spam filtering, HTTP downloads,
building tarballs, warming caches and basically everything else you can imagine
that's not super fast.

  use Mojolicious::Lite;

  plugin Minion => {Pg => 'postgresql://sri:s3cret@localhost/test'};

  # Slow task
  app->minion->add_task(poke_mojo => sub {
    my $job = shift;
    $job->app->ua->get('mojolicious.org');
    $job->app->log->debug('We have poked mojolicious.org for a visitor');
  });

  # Perform job in a background worker process
  get '/' => sub {
    my $c = shift;
    $c->minion->enqueue('poke_mojo');
    $c->render(text => 'We will poke mojolicious.org for you soon.');
  };

  app->start;

Background worker processes are usually started with the command
L<Minion::Command::minion::worker>, which becomes automatically available when
an application loads the plugin L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion>.

  $ ./myapp.pl minion worker

Jobs can be managed right from the command line with
L<Minion::Command::minion::job>.

  $ ./myapp.pl minion job

You can also add an admin ui to your application by loading the plugin
L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Minion::Admin>. Just make sure to secure access before
making your application publically accessible.

  # Make admin ui available under "/minion"
  plugin 'Minion::Admin';

To manage background worker processes with systemd, you can use a unit
configuration file like this.

  [Unit]
  Description=My Mojolicious application workers
  After=postgresql.service

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/home/sri/myapp/myapp.pl minion worker -m production
  KillMode=process

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

Every job can fail or succeed, but not get lost, the system is eventually
consistent and will preserve job results for as long as you like, depending on
L</"remove_after">. While individual workers can fail in the middle of
processing a job, the system will detect this and ensure that no job is left in
an uncertain state, depending on L</"missing_after">.

=head1 GROWING

And as your application grows, you can move tasks into application specific
plugins.

  package MyApp::Task::PokeMojo;
  use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious::Plugin';

  sub register {
    my ($self, $app) = @_;
    $app->minion->add_task(poke_mojo => sub {
      my $job = shift;
      $job->app->ua->get('mojolicious.org');
      $job->app->log->debug('We have poked mojolicious.org for a visitor');
    });
  }

  1;

Which are loaded like any other plugin from your application.

  # Mojolicious
  $app->plugin('MyApp::Task::PokeMojo');

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin 'MyApp::Task::PokeMojo';

=head1 EXAMPLES

This distribution also contains a great example application you can use for
inspiration. The
L<link checker|https://github.com/kraih/minion/tree/master/examples/linkcheck>
will show you how to integrate background jobs into well-structured
L<Mojolicious> applications.

=head1 EVENTS

L<Minion> inherits all events from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and can emit the
following new ones.

=head2 enqueue

  $minion->on(enqueue => sub {
    my ($minion, $id) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted after a job has been enqueued, in the process that enqueued it.

  $minion->on(enqueue => sub {
    my ($minion, $id) = @_;
    say "Job $id has been enqueued.";
  });

=head2 worker

  $minion->on(worker => sub {
    my ($minion, $worker) = @_;
    ...
  });

Emitted in the worker process after it has been created.

  $minion->on(worker => sub {
    my ($minion, $worker) = @_;
    my $id = $worker->id;
    say "Worker $$:$id started.";
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Minion> implements the following attributes.

=head2 app

  my $app = $minion->app;
  $minion = $minion->app(MyApp->new);

Application for job queue, defaults to a L<Mojo::HelloWorld> object.

=head2 backend

  my $backend = $minion->backend;
  $minion     = $minion->backend(Minion::Backend::Pg->new);

Backend, usually a L<Minion::Backend::Pg> object.

=head2 backoff

  my $cb  = $minion->backoff;
  $minion = $minion->backoff(sub {...});

A callback used to calculate the delay for automatically retried jobs, defaults
to C<(retries ** 4) + 15> (15, 16, 31, 96, 271, 640...), which means that
roughly C<25> attempts can be made in C<21> days.

  $minion->backoff(sub {
    my $retries = shift;
    return ($retries ** 4) + 15 + int(rand 30);
  });

=head2 missing_after

  my $after = $minion->missing_after;
  $minion   = $minion->missing_after(172800);

Amount of time in seconds after which workers without a heartbeat will be
considered missing and removed from the registry by L</"repair">, defaults to
C<1800> (30 minutes).

=head2 remove_after

  my $after = $minion->remove_after;
  $minion   = $minion->remove_after(86400);

Amount of time in seconds after which jobs that have reached the state
C<finished> and have no unresolved dependencies will be removed automatically by
L</"repair">, defaults to C<172800> (2 days). Negative values disable this removal.

=head2 tasks

  my $tasks = $minion->tasks;
  $minion   = $minion->tasks({foo => sub {...}});

Registered tasks.

=head1 METHODS

L<Minion> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::EventEmitter> and implements the
following new ones.

=head2 add_task

  $minion = $minion->add_task(foo => sub {...});

Register a task.

  # Job with result
  $minion->add_task(add => sub {
    my ($job, $first, $second) = @_;
    $job->finish($first + $second);
  });
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(add => [1, 1]);
  my $result = $minion->job($id)->info->{result};

=head2 enqueue

  my $id = $minion->enqueue('foo');
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args]);
  my $id = $minion->enqueue(foo => [@args] => {priority => 1});

Enqueue a new job with C<inactive> state. Arguments get serialized by the
L</"backend"> (often with L<Mojo::JSON>), so you shouldn't send objects and be
careful with binary data, nested data structures with hash and array references
are fine though.

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item attempts

  attempts => 25

Number of times performing this job will be attempted, with a delay based on
L</"backoff"> after the first attempt, defaults to C<1>.

=item delay

  delay => 10

Delay job for this many seconds (from now), defaults to C<0>.

=item notes

  notes => {foo => 'bar', baz => [1, 2, 3]}

Hash reference with arbitrary metadata for this job that gets serialized by the
L</"backend"> (often with L<Mojo::JSON>), so you shouldn't send objects and be
careful with binary data, nested data structures with hash and array references
are fine though.

=item parents

  parents => [$id1, $id2, $id3]

One or more existing jobs this job depends on, and that need to have
transitioned to the state C<finished> before it can be processed.

=item priority

  priority => 5

Job priority, defaults to C<0>. Jobs with a higher priority get performed first.

=item queue

  queue => 'important'

Queue to put job in, defaults to C<default>.

=back

=head2 foreground

  my $bool = $minion->foreground($id);

Retry job in C<minion_foreground> queue, then perform it right away with a
temporary worker in this process, very useful for debugging.

=head2 guard

  my $guard = $minion->guard('foo', 3600);
  my $guard = $minion->guard('foo', 3600, {limit => 20});

Same as L</"lock">, but returns a scope guard object that automatically releases
the lock as soon as the object is destroyed, or C<undef> if aquiring the lock
failed.

  # Only one job should run at a time (unique job)
  $minion->add_task(do_unique_stuff => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    return $job->finish('Previous job is still active')
      unless my $guard = $minion->guard('fragile_backend_service', 7200);
    ...
  });

  # Only five jobs should run at a time and we try again later if necessary
  $minion->add_task(do_concurrent_stuff => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    return $job->retry({delay => 30})
      unless my $guard = $minion->guard('some_web_service', 60, {limit => 5});
    ...
  });

=head2 job

  my $job = $minion->job($id);

Get L<Minion::Job> object without making any changes to the actual job or
return C<undef> if job does not exist.

  # Check job state
  my $state = $minion->job($id)->info->{state};

  # Get job metadata
  my $progress = $minion->$job($id)->info->{notes}{progress};

  # Get job result
  my $result = $minion->job($id)->info->{result};

=head2 lock

  my $bool = $minion->lock('foo', 3600);
  my $bool = $minion->lock('foo', 3600, {limit => 20});

Try to acquire a named lock that will expire automatically after the given
amount of time in seconds. You can release the lock manually with L</"unlock">
to limit concurrency, or let it expire for rate limiting. For convenience you
can also use L</"guard"> to release the lock automatically, even if the job
failed.

  # Only one job should run at a time (unique job)
  $minion->add_task(do_unique_stuff => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    return $job->finish('Previous job is still active')
      unless $minion->lock('fragile_backend_service', 7200);
    ...
    $minion->unlock('fragile_backend_service');
  });

  # Only five jobs should run at a time and we wait for our turn
  $minion->add_task(do_concurrent_stuff => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    sleep 1 until $minion->lock('some_web_service', 60, {limit => 5});
    ...
    $minion->unlock('some_web_service');
  });

  # Only a hundred jobs should run per hour and we try again later if necessary
  $minion->add_task(do_rate_limited_stuff => sub {
    my ($job, @args) = @_;
    return $job->retry({delay => 3600})
      unless $minion->lock('another_web_service', 3600, {limit => 100});
    ...
  });

These options are currently available:

=over 2

=item limit

  limit => 20

Number of shared locks with the same name that can be active at the same time,
defaults to C<1>.

=back

=head2 new

  my $minion = Minion->new(Pg => 'postgresql://postgres@/test');
  my $minion = Minion->new(Pg => Mojo::Pg->new);

Construct a new L<Minion> object.

=head2 perform_jobs

  $minion->perform_jobs;
  $minion->perform_jobs({queues => ['important']});

Perform all jobs with a temporary worker, very useful for testing.

  # Longer version
  my $worker = $minion->worker;
  while (my $job = $worker->register->dequeue(0)) { $job->perform }
  $worker->unregister;

These options are currently available:
